## Package Management in linux for beginners
----
Package manager is a tool used to install, update, configure, and remove software packages. These packages include precompiled binaries, config files, and metadata. They are essential for the software to work on a Linux system. Different Linux distributions have their own package management systems. However, the core ideas are quite similar.

Before exploring package managers on different distributions let's look at some key concepts
1.	Repositories: Centralized locations where packages are stored and maintained. They can be official (maintained by the distribution) or third-party.
2.	Package: A compressed file containing the software, its dependencies, and metadata.
3.	Dependencies: Libraries or other packages required for a software package to function correctly.
4.	Package Manager: A tool that automates the process of installing, updating, and removing packages.
